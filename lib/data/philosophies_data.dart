    tagline:  'Control what you can. Release what you cannot.',
    overview: 'Founded in Athens around 300 BCE by Zeno of Citium, Stoicism teaches that virtue — wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance — is the only true good. External circumstances such as wealth, health, and reputation are indifferent: they are neither good nor bad in themselves. We do not suffer from events but from our judgments about them. The path to a good life is to align our will with nature and reason, and to distinguish relentlessly between what is within our power and what is not.',
    coreBeliefs: [
      'The dichotomy of control: our judgments, desires, and actions are "up to us." Everything else — outcomes, others\' opinions, health — is not.',
      'Virtue is the only genuine good. Everything else is "preferred indifferent" — useful, but not worth compromising your character for.',
      'Emotions arise from false judgments. Destructive emotions can be dissolved by examining the beliefs underlying them.',
      'We are all part of a rational cosmos. What is good for the whole is good for us, even when it is painful.',
      'Negative visualization (premeditatio malorum): regularly imagining loss trains genuine appreciation and removes fear.',
    ],
    keyThinkers: ['Marcus Aurelius', 'Epictetus', 'Seneca', 'Zeno of Citium', 'Chrysippus'],
    practicalApplication:
        'When something upsets you, ask one question: "Is this in my control?" If not, your suffering is optional — chosen by the story you are telling. If yes, act. Stoics keep a daily journal not to record events but to examine their responses. Marcus Aurelius wrote his private notes not for publication but to hold himself accountable to his own principles. Start there: write one thing that bothered you today, one judgment you made about it, and one you would make instead if you were at your best.',
    criticisms:
        'Critics argue Stoicism can suppress legitimate emotional expression, encouraging a kind of emotional numbness that looks like strength but avoids genuine processing. The dichotomy of control may be used to justify passivity toward systemic injustice — "it\'s not in my control" becomes an excuse for disengagement. The ideal of the Stoic sage — perfectly rational, unmoved by passion — is inhuman and perhaps counterproductive as a goal. Stoicism also emerged from a position of relative privilege; for many, circumstances genuinely are the problem, not merely one\'s judgments about them.',

    tagline:  'Existence precedes essence. You define yourself.',
    overview: 'Existentialism holds that humans exist first and define themselves afterward — there is no pre-given human nature, no fixed purpose handed to us by God or evolution. We are "condemned to be free," as Sartre put it: radically responsible for every choice, unable to hide behind excuses of fate or circumstance. This freedom is terrifying (existential anxiety) and exhilarating in equal measure. Authenticity — living in accordance with your own honestly examined values rather than collapsing into social expectations — is the core existentialist virtue.',
    coreBeliefs: [
      'Existence precedes essence: we have no fixed nature or pre-given purpose. We create ourselves through our choices.',
      'Radical freedom and radical responsibility: we cannot escape choosing, and every choice defines us.',
      'Bad faith (mauvaise foi): lying to yourself about your freedom — "I had no choice," "that\'s just how I am" — is existential cowardice.',
      'Authenticity: living honestly according to your own examined values, not borrowed ones.',
      'Intersubjectivity: others are not obstacles to freedom but the very mirror in which we discover ourselves.',
    ],
    keyThinkers: ['Jean-Paul Sartre', 'Simone de Beauvoir', 'Albert Camus', 'Søren Kierkegaard', 'Martin Heidegger'],
    practicalApplication:
        'Existentialism gives you a powerful diagnostic tool: whenever you feel stuck, trapped, or victimized, examine whether you are in bad faith — pretending you have less freedom than you actually do. This is not about blaming yourself but about reclaiming agency. Sartre argued that even the refusal to choose is a choice. Start by asking: "What am I pretending I cannot change?" Then ask: "What am I afraid would happen if I took responsibility for changing it?" That fear — not circumstance — is usually the actual obstacle.',
    criticisms:
        'Existentialism can trigger decision paralysis: if every choice matters enormously and defines who you are, choosing becomes unbearable. Critics argue it underestimates how much social structures, class, race, and trauma genuinely constrain freedom — radical responsibility can slide into blaming the oppressed for their own oppression. The emphasis on individual authenticity can also become narcissistic, elevating personal truth above community and care. Existential anxiety, treated as an inescapable condition, can be counterproductive for those already prone to anxiety disorders.',

    tagline:  'Life is meaningless. Live anyway — with everything.',
    overview: 'Albert Camus proposed that the fundamental tension of human life is the collision between our desperate need for meaning, clarity, and order, and the universe\'s absolute silence in response. This gap is the Absurd. Camus rejected two common responses: suicide (giving up) and the "leap of faith" (pretending the silence has been answered). Instead he proposed revolt — a conscious refusal to be defeated by meaninglessness — combined with freedom and passion. To live fully despite knowing it doesn\'t ultimately matter is, for Camus, the only authentic response to being human.',
    coreBeliefs: [
      'The Absurd is the conflict between the human need for meaning and the universe\'s silence. It cannot be resolved, only lived.',
      'Neither suicide nor religious escape is an honest answer to the Absurd.',

      'Passion: without eternal stakes, intensity of experience becomes its own justification.',
    ],
    keyThinkers: ['Albert Camus', 'Søren Kierkegaard (rejected)', 'Franz Kafka', 'Samuel Beckett'],
    practicalApplication:
        'Absurdism is most useful when you notice you are suffering because things "should" be different or have a clear purpose. Camus\'s answer: they don\'t, and that is fine. Sisyphus is condemned to roll a boulder up a hill forever. Camus\'s final sentence in The Myth of Sisyphus is: "One must imagine Sisyphus happy." Not because the task has meaning, but because he has chosen to be fully present to it. Apply this to the repetitive, thankless, or meaningless-seeming parts of your own life: can you bring full presence and revolt rather than resentment?',
    criticisms:
        'Absurdism is philosophically compelling but offers little practical guidance when you actually have to make ethical choices. Camus\'s insistence on revolt and passion can seem like an aesthetic pose rather than a livable ethic. Critics note it does not adequately address obligations to other people or to justice. Nietzsche and Sartre both found it too passive — mere acceptance of the void rather than active creation.

    tagline:  'Nothing is inherently meaningful. Create your own or don\'t.',
    overview: 'Nihilism — from the Latin nihil, "nothing" — is the view that life has no objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. While often portrayed as the bleakest of philosophies, Nietzsche (who diagnosed nihilism rather than endorsed it) saw it as a necessary stage: the old values are dead, the new ones have not yet been created. This "active nihilism" is a clearing — painful but necessary — that forces authentic self-creation. The challenge nihilism poses is not "nothing matters" as an endpoint, but "now what?" as a beginning.',
    coreBeliefs: [
      'No objective meaning, purpose, or moral truth exists independently of human minds.',
      '"God is dead" — not a theological claim, but a cultural diagnosis: the frameworks that gave traditional life coherence have collapsed.',

    ],
    keyThinkers: ['Friedrich Nietzsche', 'Arthur Schopenhauer', 'Ivan Turgenev'],
    practicalApplication:
        'Nihilism at its most useful is a diagnostic, not a destination. When you notice you have been operating on values you absorbed from family, culture, or religion without ever choosing them, nihilism is the acid that dissolves them so you can examine what, if anything, you want to replace them with. The question is not "does anything matter?" but "what do I — on examination, freely — choose to treat as mattering?" Nietzsche\'s answer was: create beauty, pursue excellence, affirm life so completely that you would choose to live it again, exactly as it was. That is not despair. That is the hardest form of courage.',
    criticisms:
        'Nihilism has historically been misappropriated to justify cruelty, indifference, and atrocity on the grounds that "nothing matters anyway." Nietzsche himself was horrified by proto-Nazi misreadings of his work. Passive nihilism — the "nothing matters so why try" conclusion — is associated with depression, anhedonia, and social withdrawal. Without a constructive step beyond mere negation, nihilism offers no resources for ethics, relationships, or community. It is also arguably self-refuting: if nothing matters, neither does nihilism.',

    overview: 'Taoism is an ancient Chinese philosophy centred on the Tao (道) — the Way, the natural order and flow underlying all existence. Where Western philosophy often asks "what should I do?" Taoism asks "how should I be?" Its key concept is wu wei (無為) — effortless, non-forced action aligned with nature rather than imposed on it. Water is the Taoist symbol: yielding, soft, but wearing away stone. Taoism teaches that striving, forcing, and over-controlling produce their own undoing, while genuine emptiness and stillness contain everything.',
    coreBeliefs: [
      'The Tao is the fundamental nature of reality — not a god, not a force, but the ground of all being. It cannot be fully described in words.',

    keyThinkers: ['Laozi', 'Zhuangzi', 'Liezi'],
    practicalApplication:
        'Taoism is most practically useful in two situations: when you are exhausted by striving, and when you are trying to force a resolution to something that needs to unfold on its own time. Wu wei does not mean doing nothing — it means doing what the situation genuinely calls for, not what your anxiety, ego, or impatience demands. The question to ask is: "Am I pushing because this action is genuinely needed, or because I am afraid of what will happen if I stop pushing?" Very often, the anxiety behind frantic effort produces exactly the outcomes it fears.',
    criticisms:
        'Taoism\'s vagueness is both its strength and weakness. "Go with the flow" can justify indecision, irresponsibility, and passivity toward genuine injustice. The Taoist tradition has been criticized for political conservatism — accepting the natural order can mean accepting oppression. Its mysticism makes it difficult to apply systematically.

    overview: 'Humanism is a philosophical and ethical orientation that affirms the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively. It holds that through reason, evidence, and compassion — rather than divine revelation or metaphysical authority — humans can discover how to live well and build a just society. Humanism is not anti-religious in its essence but rejects supernatural explanations and authorities as the basis for ethics or knowledge. It places the full weight of responsibility for human flourishing on human beings themselves.',

        'Humanism is particularly useful when you are struggling with guilt derived from religious or cultural frameworks you have outgrown, or when you are trying to build an ethical foundation without traditional belief. The humanist question is: "What would genuinely serve human flourishing — mine and others\'?" This reframes morality from obedience to a code into a genuine inquiry. Humanism also encourages civic engagement: the world does not improve by itself, and retreat into private virtue is not enough.

    overview: 'Pragmatism is a distinctly American philosophical tradition holding that the meaning and value of an idea lies in its practical consequences. Rather than asking "is this true in some abstract sense?" pragmatists ask "what difference does it make whether we believe this?" Truth is not a fixed correspondence to an independent reality but a property ideas acquire insofar as they help us navigate and act in the world. Knowledge is provisional — always subject to revision in light of new experience — and inquiry is fundamentally a problem-solving activity.',

    practicalApplication:
        'Pragmatism is immediately useful when you are stuck in ideological or theoretical arguments that are not helping you solve your actual problem. The pragmatist question is: "What would believing X cause me to do differently? And would those actions produce better outcomes?" This cuts through abstract debates about what is "really" true or what you "should" believe and refocuses on what is working and what is not. It also frees you from bad sunk-cost thinking: if a strategy, belief, or relationship is not producing the outcomes you need, pragmatism permits you to revise without feeling like a hypocrite.',
    criticisms:
        'Pragmatism is accused of reducing truth to usefulness — which can justify deeply immoral beliefs if they happen to "work" for someone. Critics note it lacks a robust theory of justice: what works for the powerful may not work for the marginalized. Pragmatism\'s anti-foundationalism can slide into relativism, making it hard to criticize practices that are locally "useful."

    overview: 'Epicurus (341–270 BCE) taught that the highest human good is pleasure — but not the hedonism of popular imagination. He distinguished between kinetic pleasures (active pleasures of the senses) and catastematic pleasures (stable states of tranquility and absence of pain). The goal is ataraxia — a deep, untroubled calm — and aponia, freedom from physical pain. Epicurus believed true pleasure comes from simple things: good food shared with friends, philosophical conversation, freedom from fear of death and gods. Intense excitement and luxury actually disturb the peace we seek.',

    practicalApplication:
        'Epicureanism is most useful when you are caught in the hedonic treadmill — always pursuing the next bigger pleasure while the last one has already faded. Epicurus\'s prescription is radical simplification: identify your truly necessary desires and satisfy them reliably, then invest the remainder of your energy in deep friendships and philosophical self-understanding. He also offers a striking framework for anxiety: most of what we fear is either outside our control, unlikely, or involves death — which we will not be present to experience. The Epicurean practice is to genuinely examine your fears and ask which ones are worth the mental energy you are spending on them.',
    criticisms:
        'Epicureanism is criticized for its retreat from civic and political life — "live hidden," as the slogan goes. This privatism has been seen as irresponsible by those who believe philosophy should engage with social reality.

The Four Noble Truths: suffering exists; it arises from craving and clinging; it can cease; the Eightfold Path is the way to cessation. Key teachings include impermanence (anicca) — all phenomena arise and pass away; no fixed self (anatta) — what we call "I" is a flowing process, not a static entity; and interdependence (pratītyasamutpāda) — nothing exists independently of everything else.',

        'Buddhist practice offers highly specific tools for working with suffering. When you notice distress, the inquiry is: "What am I clinging to here?" — a desire for things to be different, an identity to be preserved, an outcome to be guaranteed. The practice of observing thoughts without identifying with them (mindfulness) is not about achieving a blank mind but about creating a gap between stimulus and reaction where choice can live. Buddhism is also unusual in its direct engagement with impermanence as a comfort rather than a threat: nothing is permanent, including this pain, this anxiety, this shame.',
    criticisms:
        'Buddhist philosophy is criticized for potentially encouraging passivity toward social injustice — if suffering is caused by internal craving, structural change may seem unnecessary. The concept of no-self is philosophically challenging and can be misused to dissolve the sense of agency needed to act.

      'The goal of ethics is not rule-following or consequence-calculation but the development of excellent character.',
      'Virtues are stable dispositions cultivated through practice — like a skill, not a one-time decision.',

    practicalApplication:
        'The central virtue-ethics question is not "what is the right rule?" but "what would a person of excellent character do?" This is more useful than it sounds: rather than agonizing over abstract principles, you ask "what would a courageous, wise, and just version of me do here?" and then act from that. It also reframes ethics as identity formation over time rather than a series of discrete decisions. Character is built by accumulation: every small choice either reinforces or erodes a disposition. The question is not just "should I do this?" but "what kind of person am I becoming by doing this repeatedly?"',
    criticisms:
        'Virtue ethics is criticized for being culturally relative — different societies have called different traits virtues, including domination and aggression. It can be paternalistic: telling people how to be rather than leaving them free to determine their own values. It provides limited guidance in specific ethical dilemmas where competing virtues conflict. Critics also note it can be elitist, assuming that virtue is available to everyone equally regardless of social conditions — when in fact poverty, trauma, and systemic oppression significantly constrain character formation.',

    tagline:  'Reason alone illuminates truth. Question everything.',
    overview: 'Rationalism holds that reason — not sense experience alone — is the primary source of genuine knowledge. Descartes famously began by doubting everything that could possibly be doubted, arriving at cogito ergo sum: "I think, therefore I am" — the one indubitable truth from which to reconstruct knowledge. Rationalists believe reality has a logical, mathematical structure that reason can discover a priori (before or independent of specific experience). Spinoza\'s Ethics, written in geometrical form, is the purest expression: all of reality deducible from first principles as theorems follow from axioms.',
    coreBeliefs: [
      'Reason, not sensory experience, is the most reliable source of genuine knowledge.',

    ],
    keyThinkers: ['René Descartes', 'Baruch Spinoza', 'Gottfried Leibniz', 'Immanuel Kant'],
    practicalApplication:
        'Rationalism is most practically useful as an epistemic discipline: a commitment to examining your beliefs systematically rather than inheriting them from emotion, authority, or tradition. The Cartesian practice of methodical doubt is genuinely valuable: take a belief you hold strongly and ask what would count as evidence against it. If you cannot answer that question, you are not reasoning — you are rationalizing. Rationalism also encourages intellectual humility: if reason can in principle reach truth, then genuine argument should be able to change your mind, and you should be open to that.',
    criticisms:
        'Rationalism\'s insistence on a priori knowledge has been challenged by empiricism: Hume argued that all genuine knowledge comes from experience, and that reason alone cannot tell us facts about the world. The history of "purely rational" systems — from Descartes to 20th-century utopias — suggests that reason unchecked by empirical feedback produces elegant but false systems. Rationalism also underestimates emotion\'s role in cognition: modern neuroscience suggests that reason and emotion are not opposed but interdependent. The ideal of the purely rational agent is also psychologically unlivable.',

    tagline:  'Social conventions are a prison. Virtue needs nothing else.',
    overview: 'The ancient Cynics — founded by Antisthenes and made famous by Diogenes of Sinope — held that virtue is the only good and that conventional society\'s values (wealth, status, power, pleasure) are not merely unimportant but actively corrupting. The Cynic ideal was autarkeia — complete self-sufficiency — and parrhesia — radical, shameless honesty. Diogenes lived in a barrel, begged for food, and met Alexander the Great with the request "stop blocking my sun." The Cynics were the original counter-culture, and their influence runs from early Christianity through Stoicism to contemporary anti-consumerism.',

      'Conventional society\'s values corrupt rather than support the good life.',

    ],
    keyThinkers: ['Diogenes of Sinope', 'Antisthenes', 'Crates of Thebes', 'Hipparchia'],
    practicalApplication:
        'Cynicism\'s most useful practice is ruthless examination of which of your desires and anxieties are genuinely yours and which are socially manufactured. Most of what people suffer over — social status, appearance, others\' opinions, keeping up appearances — is, in Cynic terms, purely conventional: agreed-upon fictions we have mistaken for necessities. The diagnostic question is: "Would I care about this if I lived alone on an island?" If not, it deserves far less power over you than you are currently granting it. Cynicism is also a powerful antidote to hypocrisy — the Cynic holds themselves to the same standard they apply to others.',
    criticisms:
        'Ancient Cynicism was deliberately antisocial and is difficult to apply in community life. Its celebration of radical poverty, shamelessness, and rejection of social norms can be used to justify neglect of real responsibilities. The Cynic contempt for conventional goods can become self-righteous — a performance of virtue that judges others from a position of manufactured superiority. Modern "cynicism" — as pessimistic worldly-wisdom — is nearly opposite to the ancient version, and the ancient version\'s asocial extremism is not a practical model for contemporary life.',
